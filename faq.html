    <h2>Neapolitanish Dough Recipe</h2>
    <p><em>Yields 7x 250 gram dough balls</em></p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1000 grams [8 cups] of flour (90% strong bread flour and 10% whole grain flour)</li>
        <li>630 grams [2 ¾ cups] of water room temp (68°F–72°F)</li>
        <li>150 grams [¾ cup] of sourdough starter or biga (room temp 3–12 hours after feeding, see recipe)</li>
        <li>20 grams [2 tbsp] of extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>30 grams [2 tbsp] of sea salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Bakers Percentages</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>100% flour</li>
        <li>63% water</li>
        <li>15% starter</li>
        <li>2% extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>3% sea salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Preferment Instructions (Biga, Sponge, Poolish)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>80 grams [½ cup] high protein or bread flour</li>
        <li>70 grams [6 tbsp] water</li>
        <li>0.5 gram [¼ tsp] instant yeast</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In a bowl, add room temperature water and instant yeast, mix together until dissolved. 
        Add flour and mix vigorously until it completely comes together. Cover the bowl and allow it 
        to sit at room temperature. Use anywhere from 3–15 hours before making pizza dough as a substitute for sourdough starter.
    </p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Weigh out all ingredients in separate containers, remove 10 grams of water and reserve.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, add flours.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, add water and starter; break up starter into the water.</li>
        <li>Create a crater in the flour and pour starter and water mixture into the center.</li>
        <li>Begin mixing with one hand in the center of the bowl in a clockwise fashion until the dough comes together into one ball. Pour in olive oil and continue mixing, squishing the oil into the dough. When the ball has just come together and the bowl is clean, stop mixing, and cover with plastic wrap.</li>
        <li>Rest for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Uncover the dough and begin mixing by hand. Add the 10 grams of reserved water, slowly adding 30 grams of sea salt as you mix by hand.</li>
        <li>In a large lightly oiled container, add the entire dough ball, cover, and rest for 5 hours at room temperature. Perform one stretch and fold halfway through.</li>
        <li>Remove the entire dough ball and place it on a lightly floured surface.</li>
        <li>Lightly flour your hands and, using your dough cutter and scale, begin portioning the dough into 250-gram balls.</li>
        <li>Form dough balls by folding each in on itself, stitching up the bottom, and creating a smooth ball. Handle quickly and gently to avoid transferring too much heat.</li>
        <li>Place dough balls on a lightly floured half sheet (3×2). Lightly flour the surface and cover with plastic wrap and a half sheet cover.</li>
        <li>Proof for 12–18 hours at cool room temperature or until the dough balls have doubled in size (if the room is warmer, proof for less time). Use to make pizza or move to the refrigerator.</li>
        <li>Dough balls will be usable for up to 48 hours in the refrigerator.</li>
    </ol>
